This project first explored factors that might be related to students' graduation rate in an anonymous graduate program. During the analysis, a hidden factor, Covid-19, was discovered. It was tested to be significantly related to graduation rate. Inlcluding it as an additional predictor and using logistic regression, a model that can make predictions with high accuracy, precision, and recall was found.
